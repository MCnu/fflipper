fflipper
================================

A video clipper that takes ELAN files as it's input, and generates clips based on the annotations in a selected tier.

TODO
-------------------------
* implement tier chooser (tk?)
* implement tier annotation collapse
* allow different tiers to generate folders rather than collapse
* package for distribution
* clean up imports
